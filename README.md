Pay minimum payments on all debts, then attack the smallest balance with everything extra. As each debt is paid off, roll that payment into the next smallest debt, creating a "snowball" effect.

### Biblical Giving Structure
- **Tithe (10%)**: The first 10% belongs to God
- **Offerings**: Given above the tithe in worship
- **Firstfruits**: The best portion of any increase
- **Alms**: Giving to those in need

### Financial Health Score
Calculated based on:
- Faithful tithing (20 points)
- Regular saving (15 points)
- Debt elimination (15 points)
- Budget adherence (50 points)

## üìñ Biblical Foundation

The app is built on key biblical principles:
- "The borrower is slave to the lender" (Proverbs 22:7)
- "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse" (Malachi 3:10)
- "Let no debt remain outstanding" (Romans 13:8)
